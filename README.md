# Decentralized-identity-management-system
A JavaScript implementation of a very simple blockchain-based identity management system, where identities are added as blocks to a blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
Uses the SHA256 hash function from the Crypto-js library. The blockchain is implemented using classes for Blocks and the Blockchain. The DIMS is implemented as a class that uses the Blockchain class for storing the identities (id, name, dob, and address)
